This analysis focuses on a popular social media platform, Twitter. Twitter is an interactive application where its users share their opinions regarding several topics across the globe. 

The dataset used for this assignment was obtained from Kaggle. Manas Garg, the originator of this dataset compiled a CSV file of over 10000 tweets in order to be able to detect the state of the mental health of Twitter users. The CSV file contains the annotated text that is labelled with 0 and 1. 0 means positive sentiment to show that the user is in a stable mental state while 1 means negative sentiment which denotes depression.
